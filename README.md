### Bike Share Project

#### Description
This project is about providing some statistics for a bike rental service, which serves in the metropolitan area of Chicago, New York City and Washingtion D.C.

The original project was designed for the completion of a course project in the "Introduction to Programming with Python for Data Science" nanodegree program of the Udacity platform.

The project is designed with a simple user interface on terminal. It basically asks the user which city they would like to see the statistics from, and some filters to limit the demographic of the computed statistic.
